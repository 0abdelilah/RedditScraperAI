TASK: You are given several Reddit posts (each with title, body, comments, and replies).

For EACH post, extract the following:

1. "pain_point": The main frustration/problem explicitly mentioned (1–2 sentences, quoted or paraphrased directly from the text).
2. "classification": One of:
    "personal" – individual life/behavioral struggles
    "niche" – very specific audience or rare problem
    "tool_limitation" – shortcomings of an existing product/service
    "time_drain" – problem wastes excessive time
3. "problem_type": Short label (e.g., "time_waste", "money_loss", "unclear_process", etc.).
4. "reoccurrence": Integer (count how many times the same/similar pain point appears across posts).

RULES:
- Only use information explicitly present in the posts/comments.
- Do NOT invent, speculate, or generalize beyond what is written.
- Be concise, consistent, and objective.
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no explanations or extra text).
- If no clear pain point exists, return empty strings for fields.
- Only include pain points that people would realistically pay to solve (because it will gain them money or wastes significant time...).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

[
  {
    "id": <post_id>,
    "pain_point": "...",
    "classification": "...",
    "problem_type": "...",
    "reoccurrence": <int>
  }
]
