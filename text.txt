1. Add external validation signals
    Search Google/Reddit/Twitter → How many people complain about the same issue?
    Check existing tools (Crunchbase, Product Hunt, GitHub) → If there are already competitors, demand exists.
    Keyword volume (SEO/Ads tools) → Check if people actively search for solutions.


2. a second LLM prompt can then filter for recurring/niche-but-scalable ones.


5. Automate iteration
    Does the same frustration appear in multiple posts?
    Those are your strongest signals → better microsaas candidates.
